I notice that the original file content appears to be empty, but the diff is trying to add content that seems to be part of a larger React component. Since there's no original content to work with, I cannot generate the complete file content that would result from applying this diff.

The diff appears to be adding an admin panel link with conditional rendering based on user role, but without the surrounding context from the original file, I cannot provide the complete file content.
